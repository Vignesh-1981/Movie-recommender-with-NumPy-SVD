# Movie-recommender-with-NumPy-SVD
This Jupyter notebook details a movie recommender built with NumPy and SVD. It uses the MovieLens dataset to create a user-item matrix. SVD decomposes this matrix to find latent features, which are then used to predict ratings for unseen movies. The model's accuracy is evaluated using RMSE and MAE, and it provides personalized movie recommendations
